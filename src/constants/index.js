export const ABOUT_TEXT = `Hello, I'm Muhammad Haseeb Tariq, a motivated BSCS student with a strong passion for web development and Full Stack development. Since 2019, I have been working in the industry, gaining a diverse skill set across various roles and projects.
Currently, I am an Associate Developer at Unique Track Pvt. Ltd., where I have been working since 2021. In this role, I am responsible for developing and maintaining websites using the Enfold WordPress theme, a platform where I specialize in theme customization and plugin integration. My expertise with the Enfold theme has allowed me to create dynamic, user-friendly websites that meet and exceed client expectations. 
In addition to my WordPress development work, I have also set up a WhatsApp Chatbot using the WhatsApp Web JS library, Node.js, and Express.js. This project involved collaborating with stakeholders to define project requirements and timelines, ensuring the final product was both functional and aligned with business objectives.
Before my current role, I served as a Customer Relationship Officer and Digital Strategist at Unique Track Pvt. Ltd. from 2020 to 2021. During this time, I handled customer queries and complaints, developed and implemented digital marketing strategies, conducted call quality audits, and identified areas for enhancement in inbound and outbound calls to generate leads and build trustworthy client relationships.
My career began in 2018 as a class teacher and lecturer at New Kashmir School in Lahore, where I was responsible for developing and delivering lesson plans, assessing student performance, and lecturing on Computer Science for 9th and 10th grades. I also worked as a Call Center Agent at Precision Estimation in 2019, engaging with customers to generate leads, managing inbound and outbound calls, and training new staff members. In the same year, I provided customer support as a Customer Support Officer at Unique Track Pvt. Ltd.
I am proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and Node.js, with extensive experience in WordPress theme customization and plugin integration. My work with the Enfold theme has equipped me with the skills to create visually appealing and highly functional websites. I possess basic knowledge of SEO principles and am familiar with Git. My strong communication and teamwork skills further enhance my professional capabilities.
My educational background includes matriculation from BISE Lahore with a C Grade, intermediate studies from BISE Lahore with a B Grade, and an ADP CS from UCP ADP Campus (PGC Airline) with a 3.64 CGPA, 90.02% - A Grade. I am currently pursuing a BSCS from the Virtual University of Pakistan.
I am seeking a challenging role as a Full Stack Developer, where I can leverage my technical skills and passion for coding to contribute to the design, implementation, and management of web applications. My ultimate goal is to excel as a Full Stack Developer, and I am eager to apply my knowledge in a supportive team environment to deliver high-quality solutions.
